### Hi there, I'm Kacper, a front-end developerðŸ‘‹

Front-End developer, experienced with Angular and TypeScript technologies. 

I am a fast learner developer, who likes to be challenged and work on tight schedules. I enjoy adapting to new technologies.

I am a person with a lot of desire to work and learn new trades. I'm not afraid of any type of work. I consider myself a responsible, hard-working, communicative, friendly person with a good presence in front of the public.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning React, JavaScript and Spring Boot.
